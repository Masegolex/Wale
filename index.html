          Wale, my genius, my inspiration, my favorite personâ€”today is all about
          celebrating you! From the moment you came into my life, you've amazed
          me in ways words canâ€™t fully capture. Your mind is brilliant, your
          heart is kind, and your presence is a gift to everyone lucky enough to
          know you.

        <p>
          I hope today reminds you of how incredibly special you are. You have a
          rare light, one that shines so effortlessly, and I want you to always,
          always believe in yourself the way I believe in you. Your dreams are
          limitless, and I have no doubt that you will achieve everything your
          heart desires.
        </p>

          wonderful. I love and appreciate you more than words can say.
